The idea is to use an open data API, probably from DB to get the night trains that exist accross Europe onto a small DB.

Then a UI would show the routes on top of a map, and allow you to filter them to allow you to plan trips that include night trains.

It'd be easy to answer questions like:
- If I'm near this city, where can I go by nigh train?
- If I want to arrive to this place, where can I travel from with a night train?

This is not to plan the whole trip, but to get some night train ideas to then include in the trip.
